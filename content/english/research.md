My research focuses on:

- Audio and music machine learning
- Multimodal systems
- Generative model steering
- Transformers for error detection
- Deepfake detection and authenticity verification

I work at the intersection of audio DSP, deep learning, and multimodal modeling, with a focus on reliable detection of synthetic media and model steering for music and speech.
