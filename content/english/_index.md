I’m a 3rd-year ECE PhD student at Purdue University, supervised by [Dr. Yung-Hsiang Lu](https://yhlu.net). My work focuses on audio and music machine learning, specifically music practice error detection, music source separation, and reliable detection of synthetic and manipulated media with Audio Large Language Models.

**Currently:** incoming Audio Applied Research Scientist Intern at Shure Incorporated (May–Aug 2026).
