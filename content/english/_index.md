I’m a 3rd-year ECE PhD candidate at Purdue University. My work focuses on audio and music machine learning, specifically music practice error detection, music source separation, and reliable detection of synthetic and manipulated media with Audio Large Language Models.

**Currently:** seeking AI/ML research internships and collaborations.

**Experience (summary):**
- Applied Research Scientist Intern @ Reality Defender (2025)
- Graduate Research Assistant @ Purdue University (2024–present)
- Startup Founder @ LocaLens (2023–2024)
