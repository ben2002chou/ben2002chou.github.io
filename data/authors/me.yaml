bio: >-
  3rd-year ECE PhD Candidate at Purdue University specializing in AI/ML research for audio, music, and multimodal
  systems. Researching generative model steering, Stem separation, Transformers for error detection, and deepfake
  detection. Track record of high-impact research, including publications at AAAI, WACV and papers currently under
  review at top-tier venues with exceptional feedback. I am proficient in Audio DSP, Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and
  HPC clusters. I also have organizational and communication skills (experience organizing 3 AI4Music workshops).
